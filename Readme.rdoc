== DESCRIPTION:

Juicer is a command line tool that helps you ship frontend code for production.

High level overview; Juicer can

* figure out which files depend on each other and merge them together, reducing
  the number of http requests per page view, thus improving performance
* use YUI Compressor or Google Closure Compiler to compress code, thus improving performance
* verify that your JavaScript is safe to minify/compress by running JsLint on it
* cycle asset hosts in CSS files
* add "cache busters" to URLs in CSS files
* recalculate relative URLs in CSS files, as well as convert them to absolute
  (or convert absolute URLs to relative URLs)
* embed images into stylesheets using data-uris

== FEATURES:

=== Merging and minifying

Juicer can read @import statements in CSS files and use them to combine all your
stylesheets into a single file. This file may be minified using the YUI
Compressor or Google Closure Compiler. Eventually it will support other minifying tools too.

Juicer can treat your JavaScript files much the same way too, parsing a comment
switch @depend, as this example shows:

  /**
   * My script file
   *
   * @depend jquery-1.4.1.js
   */
  var myNS = {
      myObject = {}
  };

Running <tt>juicer merge</tt> on this file will result in a minified file
<tt>filename.min.js</tt> containing the file jquery-1.4.1.js (located in the
same directory) and the code above.

You can use @import (CSS files) and @depend (JavaScript) recursively, effectively
creating a dependency chain for Juicer to climb and merge.

=== Paths

When merging CSS files, you may want to merge CSS files in different directories.
You may also want the resulting CSS file to end up in another directory as well.
Juicer automatically recalculates referenced URLs to reflect this change.

Absolute URLs are not changed by default, but if you provide juicer merge
with <code>--document-root [DIR]</code> and <code>--relative-urls</code> then
absolute URLs are converted to URLs relative to output directory. You can also
use <code>--absolute-urls</code> to convert all URLs to absolute ones.

=== Cache busters

Juicer supports so-called cache busters. A cache buster is a pattern in a path
whose only purpose is to "trick" browsers to redownload a file when it has
changed in cases where a far future expires header is used.

There are three types of cache busters.  Soft cache busters (the default) add a
parameter to the URL, like so: http://assets/images/1.png?jcb=1234567890, ie the 
letters "jcb" (as in Juicer Cache Buster) and then the timestamp of the files mtime.

Rails cache busters are similar, except they leave out the parameter name.  This
mimics the behavior of the image_tag helper in the Ruby on Rails framework, so that
images called from both CSS and from Rails views will have identical URLs.

Unfortunately, the popular web proxy Squid shipped for some time with a default
configuration which would not treat a URL as a "new" URL if the only thing changed
was the GET parameters. For this reason Juicer provides hard cache busters.

Hard cache busters result in URLs such as: http://assets/images/1-jcb1234567890.png,
ie URLs that require either renaming of files, or (more conveniently) a web
server configuration that will forward URLs to the right files anyway.

=== Embed images in stylesheets

Juicer supports embedding images into stylesheets using data uri's.

In order to be as unobtrusive as possible, you must indicate for each image that it 
can be embedded in the stylesheet by using the embed url suffix.

Example:
    
    h1 { background: url(/somepath/someimage.png?embed=true); }

When merging the stylesheets, you must specify which type of embedding you want,
currently only 'none' and 'data_uri' are supported.

    $ juicer merge my-stylesheet.css -o my-stylesheet.merged.css --embed-images data_uri
    
The result will look similar to this:

    h1 { background: url(data:image/png;base64,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); }

Embedding images in stylesheets should be used very carefully, as they will bloat 
your css files considerably, and you will loose some of the fine grained control 
over caching of images.

Before using Juicer to embed images into your stylesheets, you should have control 
over cache expiration of stylesheets.

You should also have gzip enabled, as base64 encoded images take up about 30% more 
space than serving them normally. With gzip enabled this is reduced to about 5-10% bloat. 

==== Usage scenario: Modern browsers and IE7, IE6 support

As all of the major browsers in their later incarnations support the data uri scheme, 
it is possible to just create two merged stylesheets, although you can create as many 
as you want really.

Let's assume you have the following files:

* reset.css
* layout.css
* typography.css

    /* layout.css */
    body { background: url( /images/my-body-background.png?embed=true); }

And let's assume that you want to merge these, and embed the flagged images in 
layout.css into the stylesheet.

To do this, you would have a master stylesheet that imports the other stylesheets using 
the @import statemet. It could look like this:

    /* master.css */
    @import url(reset.css)
    @import url(layout.css)
    @import url(typography.css)

Now, in order to create the two versions of the stylesheet, you would simply run 
Juicer with and without the option to embed images

    $ juicer merge master.css -o master.embedded.css --embed-images data_uri
    $ juicer merge master.css -o master.normal.css
    
In order to only load the relevant stylesheet to supporting browsers, and preventing 
doubling the effective payload of the background images, you would reference the 
stylesheets like this:

    <head>
        ...
        <!--[if gte IE 8]><!-->
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="master.embedded.css" />
        <!--<![endif]-->
        <!--[if lte IE 7]>
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="master.normal.css" />
        <![endif]-->
        ...
    </head>

The first conditional comemnt allows only non-IE and IE8+ browsers to fetch the 
<code>master.embedded.css</code> stylesheet.

The second conditional comment allows only IE7 and lower to fetch the 
<code>master.normal.css</code> stylesheet.

Be ware that if you embed images over 32kb IE8 will not show them.
In this case bump the version numers up by one in both conditional comments.

==== Browser support
Windows Vista, Windows 2003, Windows 7
Tests needed

Windows XP
* IE8 - up to 32kb IS supported
* Firefox 3.5.2 - OK 
* Opera 9.64 - OK
* Chrome 3 - OK
* Safari 4 - OK

OS X 10.6.1
* Firefox 3.5 - OK
* Firefox 2.0.20 - OK

* Opera 8.0 - OK
* Camino 1.6.10 - OK

Debian
* Opera 10 - OK

Android
* WebKit - OK

iPhone
* Safari - OK

The test used is located at http://roderick.dk/experiments/data-uri-limits/

The test used tests loading of styles using the href attribute, it is ASSUMED 
that loading images from data-uri in css has similar support.
Soon[tm] there will be a testpage with images as well.

If you have funky browser / OS combinations not listed above, please visit the 
test and send a screenshot and details about browser and OS to morgan@roderick.dk


==== Support for really old user-agents
If you plan to support user-agents that do understand conditional comments and 
does not support the data uri scheme, you will have to do some kind of detection 
of support. These user-agents would be very rare, as our browser testing shows, 
most modern user agents support data-uris.

Please note that image embedding is NOT a silver bullet, but can help reduce 
the amount of HTTP connections needed for a page.


==== MHTML Support

Due to MHTML being very awkward in it's implementation (having the absolute url 
including protocol inside the stylesheet itself), it was decided to be of very
little real value and attempts at supporting it has been dropped.
